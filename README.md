# DropshipVector

An experimental Polygon vehicle builder game in UE4. "Dropship Vector" is just the working title for now.

Nearly all the coding is with UE4's Blueprint Visual Scripting Language, which isn't ideal now that I want to show examples of my work. The larger functions should be in C++ for better efficiency, but Blueprint code compiles so much faster than the C++, so I opted for faster iterations while learning/experimenting.
